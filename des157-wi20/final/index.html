                </br></br>
                    Food waste represents a drain in resources in almost all aspects and has continued to be a major issue in the world today. It is estimated that about 40% of American food is uneaten resulting in a loss of $218 billion annually and one quarter of total water used in agriculture is spent on wasted food. Additionally, food waste is a major contributor to deforestation and accounts for about 3% of total greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S (which is equivalent to 37.4 million passenger vehicles driven in a year). Food waste also is the largest contributor by volume to landfills. While this holds true, food insecurity is just as prevalent of an issue today. While efforts should be made to reduce food waste in the first place, addressing food insecurity by reducing food waste has become an effective method to help counter both issues.

            <section id="iphonetext" class="hide"> <p>Over the past few years there have been a number of food apps that aim to sell food that would have otherwise been wasted. Particularly, there are apps that take foods that are nearing their expiration date from markets or restaurants and resell them at a discounted price.
            </br></br>
             Flashfood is an app that partners with grocery stores to sell surplus food at a discounted price of at least 50% off or more .Through this app, stores post daily offerings on foods that are approaching their best-before dates and users have the opportunity to purchase these from their grocery store. Food for All is another app that aims to reduce wasted restaurant food in Boston and New York City. This app allows users to purchase meals one hour before a restaurant closes at a highly discounted price (as high at 80%).</br></br>
            By creating a platform to connect parties with excess food and individuals who are in need of food (in these cases restaurants and grocery stores with customers), food that would otherwise be wasted is transferred to those who need them. This idea has been implemented through various kinds of apps, even including student built apps to transfer extra meal plans to college students in need of a meal. <br><br>
            In this situation, apps can be used as a tool to minimize small accounts of food waste in communities and the potential of its implementation in colleges, restaurants, and events has just begun!

        <p id="trucktext" class="hides">Of course, food apps are not the solution to food waste and food insecurity. Regardless of its ability to cure these complex and deep issues, 
            it sure has proven itself to be effective. For example, 
            Copia an app that transfers food from events to soup kitchens 
            and shelters has reported to have moved 1 million pounds of food
             to people in need instead of ending up in a landfill. 412 Food 
             Rescue has saved ore than 6 million pounds of food. Too Good To Go has 
             stated that they’ve saved more than 45 million pounds of food as well. 
        </br></br></br></br>
        A small transfer of goods from a simple application connecting those with food and those without is a great start to reducing food waste and food insecurity at the same time.
