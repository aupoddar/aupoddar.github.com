            <h2>Box Model</h2>
        </article>
        <p>The box model in CSS is a box that wraps around every HTML elements including margins, orders, padding, and the content. Depending on the way the box is defined changes the way the width 
            and height properties change. For example, if the box is defined as a block, the padding, margin and border will push the other elements away from the box.
            If the outer display is defined as an inline type, the margins and borders will adjust but the ither inline boxes will not move away from the box.

            <h2>Background Images</h2>
            <p>Background Images through CSS is typically used when wanting to only have the image serve as a background of something, meaning that seeing the whole image isn't its main purpose.
                Additionally, you can add text and elements on top of the image when it serves as the background of an element. Typically, using img is used when the image holds important semantic meaning.
                Using img ensure it will be communicated on all screen users.
