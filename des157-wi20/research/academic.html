        <p>One-third of the world’s food ends up in landfills, yet a billion people around the globe are hungry. Food waste represents a drain in resources in almost all aspects and has continued to be a major issue in the world today. It is estimated that about 40% of American food is uneaten resulting in a loss of $218 billion annually and one quarter of total water used in agriculture is spent on wasted food. Additionally, food waste is a major contributor to deforestation and accounts for about 3% of total greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S (which is equivalent to 37.4 million passenger vehicles driven in a year). Food waste also is the largest contributor by volume to landfills. While this holds true, food insecurity is just as prevalent of an issue today. While efforts should be made to reduce food waste in the first place, addressing food insecurity by reducing food waste has become an effective method to help counter both issues. Over the past few years there have been a number of food apps that aim to sell food that would have otherwise been wasted. Particularly, there are apps that take foods that are nearing their expiration date from markets or restaurants and resell them at a discounted price. Flashfood is an app that partners with grocery stores to sell surplus food at a discounted price of at least 50% off or more .Through this app, stores post daily offerings on foods that are approaching their best-before dates and users have the opportunity to purchase these from their grocery store. Food for All is another app that aims to reduce wasted restaurant food in Boston and New York City. This app allows users to purchase meals one hour before a restaurant closes at a highly discounted price (as high at 80%). Customers can view the deals, how many items are left, as well as location and pick up times. This app also allows for donations for other people in need. There are also apps that aim to help with food insecurity. For instance, over the past few years there have been a number of student created apps for college students in need of food. In 2015 at Columbia University, students developed an app called Swipes which allows students to donate their meals to classmates. This could be effective because of the number of unused swipes some students find themselves having that could be used by another. There have been other student made programs as well that have been designed to use meal plan swipes as a means of providing food for the homeless as well. Another kind of food waste preventing app that has emerged is targeted towards restaurants and is a tool to help reduce wasted food used in kitchens. For example, Wise Up on Waste is an app that calculates savings, keeps track of food uneaten, and tracks excess foods that were cooked (although this is manually entered). Overall, app development has proven itself to be a viable method to help reduce food waste and food insecurity. While improvements can be made as well as efforts to reduce excess food from being made in the first place, these apps have a significant amount of impact to improve the situation. </p>
