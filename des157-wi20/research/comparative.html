        <p>FoodForAll is an app that allows users to purchase foods at major discounts from restaurants nearing their best before date. This app is effective because it allows people to save money and also helps reduce food waste. One feature in particular that I liked is the feature that allows users to see in real time which restaurants have items remaining for purchase at a minimum discount of at least 50% with a designated pick up time. I think one part of this app that could be better is a small description of how the food is being stored. Personally, I would be hesitant to purchase already made food because of the state that I think it could be in if not stored appropriately. That’s why I think a small description under the “what to expect” page of how it is currently stored might be a useful addition.  Another part of the application that I like is the point system that they include. After gaining an amount of points, users can claim a free meal and other bonuses. I like this because I think it gives an incentive for users to actively use the app and includes a prize as a reward. Additionally I think that this makes users feel like they are benefiting from using this specific application as well as feel like they are helping reduce the amount of food that ends up going to waste. I liked that this app includes access to making donations for food purposes as well because it overall strengthens the point of the app which is to help a greater cause in a way that can still be beneficial for the user. I think that maybe another addition could be providing an option for users to directly donate money for these items to people who may need them nearby.

        <p>
            FlashFood is an app that takes surplus grocery items from local grocery stores and marketplaces that are approaching their best before dates and put them up for sale for users to purchase at 50% off. After purchasing, users can pick up their items from these stores at the discounted price. While this app functions similarly to FoodForAll, if a user is not in close proximity to a grocery store that uses this service, there is not much the user can do on the app. I think something that could be improved is also providing an option of donating money for people who may be in need of these foods so that a user who is unable to use these foods for themselves can still use the platform as a way to provide food that would go to waste to someone in need. One part of the application that I did like was that there is a savings button that records how much a user saves while using the app. I think this is a nice addition because it allows users to see the benefits that they get from using the app by being able to view how much money they’ve saved on their purchases. Overall, I feel like there is a very limited amount of functions on the app and I think including more options for the user could be helpful. Similar to FoodForAll, I think the addition of information on how the food is currently being stored would be insightful for users, especially if they feel hesitant to buy nearly approaching “expired” food. I think the most helpful part of the app is the map and the savings page because it is easy to figure out and is helpful for the user to figure out where they can go and how much money they can save.
